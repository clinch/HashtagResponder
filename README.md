# HashtagResponder
A Node.js application that will automatically respond to any tweets using a specific hashtag.

## Requirements

- This script uses [Redis](http://redis.io/) to keep track of tweets. So you need access to a Redis server. [Download the latest stable version of Redis](http://redis.io/).
- You will need access tokens to the Twitter API. Get started by creating an app at the [Twitter Dev Site](https://dev.twitter.com).

## Getting started

- There is a sample config file found at **config.json.sample**. Start by copying this to **config.json** and then edit the values found in this file to suit your needs.
